Groovy Ed - the groovy editor for dynamic language enthusiasts and craftsmen.

This project represents my attempt to reinvent the "wheel of text editing" better. Given 
the amount of time I spend in front of a text editor, I thought making
this experience more pleasant might prove useful for myself and possibly others.

This project is based on Eclipse, Groovy, SWT and JFACE.
